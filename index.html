                Hi Everyone! My name is Hamza and I am from Toronto, Canada. I moved to California in 2014 to pursue my acting career. Just kidding! I came here to do my
                Master in Public Policy here at UC Irvine where I studied developing and assessing policies which have social impacts. This ranged from Environmental impacts
                of development projects (think traffic, removing native plants and animals), labor impacts, and education impacts. I got involved into a form of programming
                when I was studying Statistics where I would use data to assess the impacts of educational programs like free lunch programs. That led me to get a job with
                an education e-learning company. My goal is to learn more about programming so I can keep my options open and so that in the future I can find a way of collaborating
                my skills to have a positive impact on educational experiences.
