                Hi Everyone! My name is Hamza and I am from Toronto, Canada. I moved to California in 2014 to pursue my
                acting career. Just kidding! I came here to do my
                Master in Public Policy here at UC Irvine.
            </p>

            <p id="history2">
                I studied developing and assessing policies, all of which have many
                social impacts. There are many applications of policy making. Some that I have studied range from Environmental impacts
                of development projects (think traffic, removing native plants and animals), labor impacts, and
                education impacts. I got introduced to a form of programming during this period.
            </p>

            <p id="history3">
                I was studying Statistics where I would use data to assess the impacts of educational programs like
                free lunch programs. That led me to get a job with
                an education e-learning company. My goal is to learn more about programming so I can keep my options
                open and so that in the future I can find a way of collaborating
                my skills and knowledge to have a positive impact on educational experiences.
            </p>

            <p id="history4">Besides all that, I enjoy dancing (Salsa and Bachata), paddleboarding, kayaking, bouldering, and skiing.</p>
